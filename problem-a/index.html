    <h1>Blair Waldorf</h1>
    <img class="fit-picture" src="img/BlairWaldorf.jpg" alt="Image of Blair Waldorf">
    <p><a href="https://gossipgirl.fandom.com/wiki/Blair_Waldorf">Blair Waldorf</a> is a character from the TV show Gossip Girl.
    she is portrayed by Leighton Meestor, one of my favorite actresses (which I think contributes to why Blair Waldorf is one of my 
    favorite characters). Blair is the daughter of Eleanor Waldrof, owner of a successful fashion house in New York. Like her mother 
    Blair is an overachiever and extremely ambitious and hardworking. Even though at times she makes questionable and manipulative 
    actions to achieve her goals, she does not leave her future to fate and takes matter into her own hands (which is something I need to work 
    on as I often leave things for the universe to handle). Despite her strong personality, she is also sensitive and does not give up on
    those that she cares about which include her best friends, her family and her significant other. She will go to the ends of the world 
    to defend them.</p>
